A handy little app to compress and store away files you're not so sure you're ready to delete. Includes a rolling delete functionality.

To install:
1) Build project.
2) Copy contents of BIN to folder on your system.
4) Set "ArchiveLocation" and "DeleteAfterDays" in App.Config.
5) Create a Shortcut to Archiver.exe in "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo" on Windows 7.

To use, right click on file and chose Archiver option in Send To.

This works on files and folders, and will work when you select multiple at once.
